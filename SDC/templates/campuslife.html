          Your first year of college presents a lot of new experiences: living away from home, meeting new people and managing your own time. Prepare for life on campus by figuring out what to bring, how to handle challenging circumstances and what you can do to manage your workload.
<br><br>

When you go away to college for the first time, you want to make sure you're prepared. You may be living on your own for the first time, so there could be some items you wouldn't normally consider taking because someone at home, such as a parent or guardian, usually takes care of them for you.  Consult your college acceptance literature for any specific items your college asks you to bring. If you're able, touch base with your roommate prior to school to make sure you're not bringing duplicates of large items such as TVs, couches or refrigerators. Having double will just take up space and make for a less comfortable environment.
<br><br>

Having a college roommate is most people's first experience living with someone who is not related to them. It comes with both benefits and challenges. Getting along with your college roommate can enhance your college experience. You get an instant friend, someone to confide in and keep you company during your first time away from home. However, since many colleges randomly assign your first roommate, you also run the risk of being matched with someone you find challenging or don't relate to right away.
<br><br> 

Think about what you really love and what you're good at; majoring in something that interests you and that you have a natural knack for will come more easily and be more enjoyable. For some students, family, cultural or financial obligations play a big role in choosing which major will fit their desired lifestyle. Talk to family and friends to get their input.
<br><br>

You should also consider what you want to do with your life, and what will make you happy, not just what career you think would pay you the most. There are several questionnaires and tests that have been developed to help you narrow your focus. Usually these tests work by measuring your abilities in a variety of academic areas, in addition to asking questions about your interests.
<br><br>

During your first year of college you will be juggling many new experiences: new friends, new living situation, new activities, new classes and new teachers. While a lot of these new experiences are exciting, they can challenge your time-management skills and academic adjustment. Even if you balanced a full course load and extracurricular activities in high school, in college you alone are responsible for deciding what your schedule will hold and managing your time accordingly. Set up some structure by giving yourself specific study hours, setting some goals for time management and sticking to them. And, do your best to eat well and get enough sleep.
